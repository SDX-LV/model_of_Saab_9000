The goal of this project is to release all source files (Blender 3.0+ model, textures, audio and documentation) as open source content (under Apache 2.0 license). It should be easy for anyone to render, use or port this model to any game or simulator (free or commercial) so that there are more virtual Saab 9000 cars for us to enjoy. 


Current 3D mesh v1.05 is a slightly cleaned-up model originally finished in 2005 for GTA Vice City. The v1.05 is fully configured as a project for Blender3 and can be used for further export into any other format. For reference, the original [GTA-ViceCity release is included as well](https://github.com/SDX-LV/model_of_Saab_9000/tree/main/RELEASES).

Note: this repository only holds original content created as art inspired by a product of a defunct company [Saab_Automobile (1945â€“2016)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_Automobile).

Note2: If you would like to use or develop further this open source project - consider contacting one of the recent contributors for more details.
