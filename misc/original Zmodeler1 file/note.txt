This ".z3d" file can be opened in ZModeler 1.07b as long as the textures from the "\3D_mesh\Textures\" and "\game_files\GTA-ViceCity\GTA textures\" folders of the initial v1.05 commit are placed in the same folder as the ".z3d" file.


Also note that "ZModeler 1.07b" does not work with very high resolution screens - try max 1920x1080 desktop resolution.
